## Description

This project was implemented for a University project with the aim of understanding the challenges involved in acquiring useful data for modern machine learning problems. The purpose of this project is to perform real-time object detection and classification of fruits and nuts using OpenCV.


## Data Acquisition

All the data used in this project was acquired from a smartphone, and it is acknowledged that OpenCV may not have been the best choice for this purpose.

## Project Overview

Inside the `cvproject` directory, you can find 5 `.py` files, each serving a different purpose in our final script.
<br/>
First a mask is applied to the images to extract valuable information features, the acquired images are analyzed and features are extracted such as hu_moments, fd_haralick, and histograms. These features are then normalized (0,1) and split between train and test datasets to evaluate the models.

## Potential Updates

Some potential improvements and updates for this project include:

- Acquiring higher quality and quantity of data.
- Incorporating more features for the classifiers to work with.
